# pes_cla_adder

This project is to implement a parameterized multiplier using carry-look-ahead adders  in Verilog. The Verilog code for the multiplier is provided. 
Users can change the number of bits of the multiplier by modifying the predefined parameters. The parameters such as MULTICAND_WID and MULTIPLIER_WID are to define the number of bits of the multiplicand and multiplier, and when we want to change the number of bits, just change these parameters and re-synthesize or simulate.
